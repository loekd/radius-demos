    - `kubectl port-forward services/dashboard 8088:80 -n radius-system`

- Explore the Radius dashboard:
    - `explorer http://localhost:8088`

# Cleanup
- hit `CTRL+C` to stop the port forward, and the app
- `rad app delete demo01 -g test -y`
- `kubectl delete ns test-demo01`

- `rad env delete test -y`
- `rad group delete test -y`
